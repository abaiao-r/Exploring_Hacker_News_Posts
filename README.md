# Analysis of Ask HN and Show HN Posts on Hacker News

## Introduction

Hacker News is a popular platform within the technology and startup communities where users submit posts to share news, ask questions, or showcase projects. This project involves analyzing a dataset of Hacker News posts to answer two primary questions:

1. Do "Ask HN" or "Show HN" posts receive more comments on average?
2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

Using Python to analyze this data, focusing on string manipulation, object-oriented programming, and date and time operations to gain insights into user engagement on Hacker News.
